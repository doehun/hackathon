This is collaborative work I've done in Spring 2015 with other researchers at the [Human Language Technology Center of Excellence](http://hltcoe.jhu.edu/). The task was to identify characteristics of Tweets of mental health illness subjects - PTSD, bipolar disorder, depression, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). 

This was done for hackathon [CLPysch 2015](http://clpsych.org/) (Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology Community).
